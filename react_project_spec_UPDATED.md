# React Project: Crowdfunding App (Part 2)

## Project Description
Kickstarter, Go Fund Me, Kiva, Change.org, Patreon… All of these different websites have something in common: they provide a platform for people to create fundraisers that they believe in, but they all have a slightly different approach. You are going to create your own crowdfunding website (this time the front-end), and put your own spin on it!

## Project Requirements ✅ ALL COMPLETED

Here's a reminder of the required features. Your crowdfunding project must:

- [x] **Be separated into two distinct projects**: an API built using the Django Rest Framework and a website built using React. 
  - Backend: `CrowdFunding_Backend` - Django 5.1 REST Framework with PostgreSQL on Heroku
  - Frontend: `crowdfunding-frontend` - React 19 with Vite on Netlify
  - Complete API-based architecture with 13 endpoints
  - **Deployment URLs:**
    - Backend: https://yubo-crowdfunding-shecodes-f2aced9e5879.herokuapp.com
    - Frontend: https://magnificent-meringue-d639f5.netlify.app

- [x] **Have a cool name**: **Glwup** - Beauty product crowdfunding platform
  - Missing vowels: G-l-w-p ✓ (Bonus points achieved!)
  - Domain: Beauty enthusiasts crowdfunding product reviews
  - Branding: Purple-pink gradient (#9b59b6 to #c44569) applied throughout

- [x] **Have a clear target audience**: Beauty enthusiasts and product testers
  - Target: People who want to fund beauty product reviews and comparisons
  - Beauty-specific features: `category` and `product_link` fields
  - Use case: Fund product testing campaigns, establish credibility in beauty niche

- [x] **Have user accounts** with all required attributes:
  - [x] Username - Custom Django user model with username field
  - [x] Email address - AbstractUser email, returned in token auth response
  - [x] Password - Hashed via `create_user()`, write_only in serializers for security

- [x] **Ability to create a "fundraiser"** with all required attributes:
  - [x] Title - CharField(max_length=200), displayed in cards and detail pages
  - [x] Owner - ForeignKey to User, auto-set on creation, enforced in updates
  - [x] Description - TextField, shown truncated in cards and full in detail view
  - [x] Image - URLField, displayed as img src in fundraiser cards
  - [x] Target amount to raise - IntegerField `goal`, used in progress bar calculations
  - [x] Whether it is currently open - BooleanField `is_open`, controls pledge acceptance
  - [x] When the fundraiser was created - DateTimeField `date_created` with auto_now_add=True

- [x] **Ability to "pledge" to a fundraiser** with all required attributes:
  - [x] An amount - IntegerField, validated > $0 at both model and serializer levels
  - [x] The fundraiser the pledge is for - ForeignKey to Fundraiser
  - [x] The supporter/user - ForeignKey to User, enforced in permission checks
  - [x] Whether the pledge is anonymous - BooleanField `anonymous` with checkbox input
  - [x] A comment - CharField(max_length=200), optional textarea in form

- [x] **Implement suitable update/delete functionality**:
  - [x] Fundraiser owners can update descriptions, goals, and status (PUT endpoint)
  - [x] Only fundraiser owners can delete campaigns (DELETE returns 204)
  - [x] Users can update their own profiles (other users get 403 Forbidden)
  - [x] Users can delete their own accounts (other users get 403 Forbidden)
  - [x] Pledge supporters can update pledges with campaign validation (IsSupporterOrReadOnly)
  - [x] Permissions enforced via custom classes: `IsOwnerOrReadOnly`, `IsSupporterOrReadOnly`

- [x] **Implement suitable permissions**:
  - [x] Duplicate pledge prevention: `unique_together = ('fundraiser', 'supporter')` in model
  - [x] Campaign closure on goal achievement: `can_accept_pledges()` method checks funding
  - [x] Optional deadline enforcement: Pledges blocked after deadline expires
  - [x] 403 responses for unauthorized edits/deletes
  - [x] User self-edit/delete: Endpoint checks if request.user.id == user.id

- [x] **Return the relevant status codes** for API requests:
  - [x] 200 OK - Successful GET requests
  - [x] 201 Created - Successful POST requests (fundraisers, pledges, users)
  - [x] 204 No Content - Successful DELETE requests
  - [x] 400 Bad Request - Validation errors (amount validation, duplicates, mismatched passwords)
  - [x] 403 Forbidden - Permission denied (non-owner edits, self-edit enforcement)
  - [x] 404 Not Found - Resource not found with custom JSON handler

- [x] **Handle failed requests gracefully**:
  - [x] Custom 404 page - NotFoundPage.jsx with styled error message and home link
  - [x] Error Boundary - React component catching runtime errors with fallback UI
  - [x] API error handling - apiCall() parses and displays readable error messages
  - [x] Form validation feedback - All forms display validation errors inline
  - [x] Django custom 404 handler - Returns JSON with detail message and 404 status

- [x] **Use Token Authentication**:
  - [x] CustomAuthToken endpoint at `POST /api-token-auth/`
  - [x] Returns token + user_id + email on successful authentication
  - [x] Frontend stores token in localStorage
  - [x] Token auto-injected in Authorization headers for all API requests
  - [x] Protected endpoints require token for POST/PUT/DELETE operations
  - [x] Token class: `rest_framework.authtoken.models.Token`

- [x] **Implement responsive design**:
  - [x] 480px breakpoint - Mobile layout (single column, reduced fonts)
  - [x] 768px breakpoint - Tablet layout (adjusted grid, better spacing)
  - [x] 1024px breakpoint - Desktop layout (multi-column grid system)
  - [x] CSS media queries in: HomePage, FundraiserDetailPage, AuthForm, NavBar
  - [x] Responsive grid: `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))`
  - [x] Touch-friendly: All buttons properly sized for mobile interaction
